## kitto neuron
A small development to identify small patterns to further understand the concept of the self learning algorithm

The pattern will be to determine if a number in a matrix is greater or less than 0 by using -1 or 1.

Sample:`
 | -1 | -1
 |  1 |  1
 |
 `
Output:`
 | 0 | 0
 | 1 | 1
 |
`
## Compiling
Open the solution "Kitto Neural.sln" with Visual Studios and compile
